## Installation

**Install NodeJS** <br>
If NodeJS is not already installed in your local machine go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download it.

**NodeJS Version** <br>
Then open the terminal and test installation by checking the node version that was installed by executing this command in the terminal: <br>
`node --version`

**NPM Version** <br>
By installing NodeJS you also get a package called `npm`. Check `npm` version by executing this command in the terminal: <br>
`npm --version`

**Running Javascript Code in the Terminal** <br>
Type `node` and hit enter in the terminal and you'll be able to add some javascript code to play with in the terminal. Press `ctrl + C` to quit the node shell.

**Running a Simple Javascript File** <br>
In the desktop create a new file `hello-world.js`. Open that file and just add this line `console.log('Hello World!');`. Then open the terminal and first `cd` to `desktop` or any folder where the `/hello-world.js` file is. Then type `node hello-world.js` and hit enter. The code inside `/hello-world.js` will now be executed and we will see the logs or any output right there in the terminal.

## Usage

**Run Entry Point File `/app.js`** <br>
If NodeJS is installed in your local machine, using the terminal go to the root folder of this project using `cd`. Once you are located in this project's root folder run the following command in the terminal to run the code inside the `/app.js` file: <br>
`node app.js`
<br><br>
Here at `/app.js` we can add any Javascript code we like to test or play with JS features.
